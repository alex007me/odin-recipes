    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Serve this beer-battered fish over a bed of salt and vinegar chips with tartar sauce and lemon. 
        Virtually every beer-battered fish recipe looks crispy coming out of the fryer, and some even stay crispy for a few minutes, but then the inevitable sogginess sets in. 
        With this simple formula and a few easy tricks, your last bite will be as crisp as your first. 
        The keys are keeping the batter really cold and patting the fish completely dry. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Batter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour</li>
        <li>1 quarter teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup lager-style beer, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cod fillets, fully thawed if frozen</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the batter: Whisk self-rising flour, rice flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Freeze until ready to use. </li>
        <li>Make the fish: Pat cod as dry as possible, then cut lengthwise into eight 1-inch-thick strips. 
            Place rice flour on a plate and season with salt. Dust cod lightly with the rice flour mixture and shake off any excess. 
            Cover a plate with crinkled foil to make a quick drying rack; place cod on top. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Finish the batter: Remove flour mixture from the freezer. 
            Pour in beer and whisk until batter is the consistency of a thick pancake batter, adding more beer as needed. </li>
        <li>Dip floured cod into the batter to coat; lift out and let excess drip off. </li>
        <li>Fry cod in batches until golden brown, dunking occasionally if needed, 3 to 4 minutes. 
            Drain on paper towels. 
            Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
